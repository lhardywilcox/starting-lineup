## Description

This application takes user input to prompts in the CLI, and creates a webpage of contact cards for their team of a manager, three engineers and an intern.

I have encountered many challenges with this application, mostly dealing with being able to think through how it should work, and then being able to translate that into code.  Another challenge for me is writing/understanding the tests.  I have practiced, and worked with a tutor, but they still seem like a completely foreign language to me.  I need to work harder to understand and/or find a better resource.

I know this application has a long way to go to meet the criteria, but as I am behind in my projects, I need to turn in what I have for now.  My goal is to return to this project and make improvements for a resubmission at a later date.  I feel like I have a better handle on some of these items now, and look forward to improving my effort with this project.

## Installation

The application uses inquirer, node, npm, html, css and javascript.  To run the application, first use npm i  in the CLI to install the dependencies, then type node index.js to start.

## Usage

When the application starts, you will be prompted to answer questions about your team.  This information will be saved into a team array, which will then be looped through to build the web page.
 
## Credits

I referred to the class exercises, and did some work with a tutor to progress this far.

## Tests

One of the intentions of this challenge was to write tests for the models.  I have not yet developed those tests, but hope to return to add them with another submission.
